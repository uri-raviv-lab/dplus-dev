# The Dplus Python API


The D+ Python API allows using the D+ backend from Python, instead of the ordinary D+ application.

The Python API works on both Windows <s>and Linux. On Linux, one minimum requirement is that glibc>=2.24 (checked using `ldd --version`)</s>.

A few examples on how to use the API are given in our [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/uri-raviv-lab/dplus-dev/blob/development/PythonInterface/getting_started.ipynb).
<!These are examples that recreate some of the figures from the D+ update paper ().>

## Installation

Installing the Python API is done using PIP:

     pip install --extra-index-url https://pypi.fury.io/theresearchsoftwarecompany/ dplus-api
    
The API was tested with Python 3.8 and newer. It *may* work with older versions of Python, although Python 2 
is probably not supported.

## Overview
 
Some notes:
 
Throughout the manual, code examples are given with filenames, such as "mystate.state".
To run the example code for yourself, these files must be located in the same directory as the script itself,
 or alternately the code can be modified to contain the full path of the file's location.

Throughout the manual, we mention "state files". A state file is a 
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) format file (https://www.json.org/), 
which describes the parameter tree and calculation settings of the D+ computation.

It is unnecessary to write a state file yourself. 
State files can either be generated from within the python interface (with the function `export_all_parameters`),
or created from the D+ GUI (by selecting File>Save All Parameters from within the D+ GUI).

**The overall flow of the Python API is as follows:**

1. The data to be used for the calculation is built by the user in an instance of the `CalculationInput` class. 
`CalculationInput` is a child class of the class `State`, which represents a program state. A `State` includes program preferences:
    - `DomainPreferences`
    - `FittingPreferences`  


2. The CalculationInput is then passed to a `CalculationRunner.Runner` class (either `EmbeddedLocalRunner` or `WebRunner`),
and the calculation function is called (`generate`, `generate_async`, `fit`, or `fit_async`).

3. The `CalculationRunner.Runner` class returns an instance of a `CalculationResult` class, 
either `FitResult` or `GenerateResult`.

Here is a very simple example of what this might look like in main.py:

```python
from dplus.CalculationInput import CalculationInput
from dplus.CalculationRunner import EmbeddedLocalRunner

calc_data = CalculationInput.load_from_state_file("mystate.state")
runner = EmbeddedLocalRunner()
result = runner.generate(calc_data)
print(result.graph)
```

A detailed explanation of the class types and their usage follows.


## CalculationRunner

The class `Runner` implemented in package `CalculationRunner` is a base abstract class.  
There are two kinds of `Runners`: `EmbeddedLocalRunner` and `WebRunner`. 
The Runner `LocalRunner` is deprecated

it can run generate and fit on calculationInput and get the result

### EmbeddedLocalRunner
The `EmbeddedLocalRunner` class can be used without D+ compiled or installed.

To use `EmbeddedLocalRunner`, create an an instance using the default constructor:
```python
from dplus.CalculationRunner import EmbeddedLocalRunner

runner = EmbeddedLocalRunner()
```

### LocalRunner
The `LocalRunner` runner class is not supported anymore, but can still be used.
It is intended for users who have the D+ executable files installed on their system. It takes two optional
initialization arguments:

* `exe_directory` is the folder location of the D+ executables. 
By default, its value is `None`. On Windows, a value of `None` will 
lead to the python interface searching the registry for an installed D+ on its own, but on linux the executable 
directory *must* be specified. 
* `session_directory` is the folder where the arguments for the calculation are stored, as well as the output results,
Amplitude files, and protein data bank (PDB) files, from the C++ executable. 
By default, its value is `None`, and an automatically generated 
temporary folder will be used. 


### WebRunner

WebRunner is currently out of use.

<s>The WebRunner is intended for users accessing the D+ server. It takes two required initialization arguments, with no
default values:

* `url` is the address of the server.
* `token` is the authentication token granting access to the server. 

```python
from dplus.CalculationRunner import WebRunner

url = r'http://localhost:8000/'
token = '4bb25edc45acd905775443f44eae'
runner = WebRunner(url, token)
```
</s>

All runner classes have the same four methods: 

* `generate(calc_data)` 
* `generate_async(calc_data)` 
* `fit(calc_data)`
* `fit_async(calc_data)` (Not implemented for all classes)

> Notice that `fit_async` is currently implemented only for the deprecated class `WebRunner`,  
meaning, it is not in use.

All four methods take the same single argument, `calc_data` - an instance of a `CalculationData` class.

## Synchronous Functions
The synchronous functions: `generate` and `fit` - return a `CalculationResult`.

When using `generate` or `fit` the program will wait until the call has finished and returned a result, before continuing. 

## Asynchronous Functions

The asynchronous functions (`generate_async` and `fit_async`) allow D+ calculations to be run in the background 
(for example, the user can call `generate_async`, tell the program to do other things, 
and then return and check if the computation is finished).

### How to use async function for `EmbeddedLocalRunner`

> The classes `WebRunner` and `LocalRunner` implement async functions different than `EmbeddedLocalRunner`.  
These classes are currently out of use. This documentation focuses on the mainly used `EmbeddedLocalRunner`.   
However, a short explanation and example about `WebRunner` and `LocalRunner` async functions following.

When an async function is called, generate or fit procedure is started, and the function returns.  
In order to get the results, the job can be polled for the status, using `get_job_status()` until it is done.

Once the job is done, call `get_generate_results(calc_data)` to get the result.  
This returns a `CalculationResult`.

```python
import datetime
from dplus.CalculationInput import CalculationInput
from dplus.CalculationRunner import EmbeddedLocalRunner

state_file=os.path.join(root_path, "files", "mystate.state")
calc_data = CalculationInput.load_from_state_file(state_file, USE_GPU)
runner = EmbeddedLocalRunner()
runner.generate_async(calc_data)
start_time = datetime.datetime.now()
status=True
while status:
    try:
        status_dict = runner.get_job_status()
        status=status_dict['isRunning']
    except:
        status=True
    run_time = datetime.datetime.now() - start_time
    if run_time > datetime.timedelta(seconds=50):
        runner.stop_generate()
        raise TimeoutError("Job took too long")
result = runner.get_generate_results(calc_data)
```

### How to use async function for `WebRunner` and `LocalRunner`

The async functions return an instance of `RunningJob`.
Call the `RunningJob.get_status` function to check if the job is done.
Once the job is done. get the result using the `RunningJob.get_result` function.

```python
import datetime
from dplus.CalculationInput import CalculationInput
from dplus.CalculationRunner import EmbeddedLocalRunner

 calc_data = CalculationInput.load_from_state_file("mystate.state")
 runner = LocalRunner()
 job = runner.generate_async(calc_data)
 start_time = datetime.datetime.now()
 status = job.get_status()
 while status['isRunning']:
     status = job.get_status()
     run_time = datetime.datetime.now() - start_time
     if run_time > datetime.timedelta(seconds=50):
         job.abort()
         raise TimeoutError("Job took too long")
 result = job.get_result(calc_data)
```

## Signal

A class that represents a Signal.
With just X values and NaN for y values, it is an uninitialized signal- eg before running generate.

|Property Name | Description|
|---|---|
|`x`|	q values|
|`y`|	 intensity values|
|`q_max`| The max q value in x|
|`q_min`|	The min q value in x (bigger or equal to 0) |
|`generated_points`| The length of x vector |

It has the methods:
* `graph` - returns order dictionary of x (q) points as keys and y points as values
* `create_x_vector` - receives qmax, qmin and generated_points and create signal instance that fit to those params
* `load_from_unordered_dictionary` - gets unordered dict of qs and their intensities and return signal instance that fit to the dict
* `load_from_unordered_pairs`- gets list of unordered pairs- qs and their intensities and return signal instance that fit to the list
* `read_from_file` - gets a file name and load the file as a Signal class 
* `get_validated`- returns a signal with no negative intensity values (remove xs and ys when the ys are negative)
* `apply_resolution_function` - gets a sigma value and apply resolution on the y according to the sigma, returns signal instance with the new value

## State
The `State` class contains an instance of each of three classes: `DomainPreferences`, `FittingPreferences`, and `Domain`. 
They are described in the upcoming sections.

It has the methods:

* `get_model`: get a model by either its `name` or its pointer, `model_ptr`.
* `get_models_by_type`: returns a list of `Models` with a given `type_name`, for example, `UniformHollowCylinder`.
* `get_mutable_params`: returns a list of `Parameters` in the state class, whose property `mutable` is `True`.
* `get_mutable_parameter_values`: returns a list of floats, matching the values of the mutable parameters.
* `set_mutable_parameter_values`: given a list of floats, sets the mutable parameters of the `State` (in the order given by 
`get_mutable_parameter_values`).
* `export_all_parameters`: given a filename, will save the calculation `State` to that file.
* `add_model`: a convenience function to help add models to the parameter tree of a 'State'. It receives the model and optionally 
a population index (default 0), and will insert that model into the population.
* `add_amplitude`: a convenience function specifically for adding instances of the `Amplitude` class, described below. 
It creates an instance of an `AMP` class with the filename of the `Amplitude`. Then, in addition to calling `add_model` with that `AMP` instance, 
it also changes the `DomainPreferences` of the `State` (specifically, `grid_size`, `q_max`, and `use_grid`), to match the properties of the `Amplitude`.
It returns the 'AMP' instance it created.	

State, _and every class and sub class contained within state_ (for example: preferences, models, parameters), all have the functions 
`load_from_dictionary` and `serialize`.

`load_from_dictionary` sets the values of the various fields within a class to match those contained within a suitable dictionary. 
It can behave recursively as necessary, for example, with a model that has children.

`serialize` saves the contents of a class to a dictionary. Note that there may be additional fields in the dictionary
beyond those described in this document, because some defunct (outdated, irrelevant, or not-yet-implemented) fields are 
still saved in the serialized dictionary.

### How to use State

The `State` class isn't usually used directly,
It is inherited by the `CalculationInput` class. More Details about `CalculationInput` can be found in the following sections.

If for any reason the `State` class is needed, it can be loaded in two different ways:

1. By using the load_from_dictionary function:
```python
s = State()
s.load_from_dictionary(state_json) # state_json is the json string describing the state
```
2. By adding a Model to population: 
```python
from dplus.DataModels.models import UniformHollowCylinder
uhc = UniformHollowCylinder()
s = State()
s.Domain.populations[0].add_model(uhc)
```


### DomainPreferences
The DomainPreferences class contains properties that are copied from the D+ interface. Their usage is explained in 
the D+ documentation.

We create a new instance of DomainPreferences by calling the python initialization function:

`dom_pref= DomainPreferences()`

There are no arguments given to the initialization function, and all the properties are set to default values:

|Property Name | Default Value | Allowed values|
|---|---|---|
|`signal`|	`an instance of signal class with qmin=0, qmax=7.5 and generated_points=800 `||
|`convergence`|	0.001||
|`grid_size`|	200|Even integer greater than 20|
|`orientation_iterations`|	100||
|`orientation_method`|	`"Monte Carlo (Mersenne Twister)"`|`"Monte Carlo (Mersenne Twister)", "Adaptive (VEGAS) Monte Carlo", "Adaptive Gauss Kronrod"`|
|`use_grid`|	`False`| `True`, `False`|
|`q_max`|	7.5|Positive number. The value comes from signal.q_max|
|`q_min`|	0|Positive number. The value comes from signal.q_min|
|`generated_points`|	800|Positive number. The value comes from signal.generated_points|
|`x`|	list of qs that fit to signal q_min, q_max and generated_point default values|list of qs. comes from signal.x|
|`y`|	with no signal file - none |list of intensities. comes from signal.y |

Any property can then be easily changed, for example, 

`dom_pref.use_grid= True`

If the user tries to set a property to an invalid value (for example, setting q_max to something other than a positive number) they will get an error.


### Fitting Preferences
The `FittingPreferences` class contains properties that are copied from the D+ interface. Their usage is explained in the D+ documentation.

We create a new instance of FittingPreferences by calling the python initialization function:

`fit_pref= FittingPreferences()`

There are no arguments given to the initialization function, and all the properties are set to default values:

|Property Name | Default Value |Allowed Values|Required when|
|---|---|---|---|
|`convergence`|	0.1| Positive numbers||
|`der_eps`|	0.1| Positive numbers||
|`fitting_iterations`|	20|Positive integers||
|`step_size`|0.01| Positive numbers||
|`loss_function`|`"Trivial Loss"`| `"Trivial Loss","Huber Loss","Soft L One Loss","Cauchy Loss","Arctan Loss","Tolerant Loss"`||
|`loss_func_param_one`|0.5|Number|Required for all `loss_function` values except "Trivial Loss"|
|`loss_func_param_two`|0.5|Number|Required when `loss_function` is "Tolerant Loss"|
|`x_ray_residuals_type`|`"Normal Residuals"`|`"Normal Residuals","Ratio Residuals","Log Residuals"`||
|`minimizer_type`|`"Trust Region"`|`"Line Search","Trust Region"`||
|`trust_region_strategy_type`|`"Levenberg-Marquardt"`|`"Levenberg-Marquardt","Dogleg"`|`minimizer_type` is `"Trust Region"`|
|`dogleg_type`|`"Traditional Dogleg"`|`"Traditional Dogleg","Subspace Dogleg"`|`trust_region_strategy_type` is `"Dogleg"`|
|`line_search_type`|`"Wolfe"`|`"Armijo","Wolfe"`|`minimizer_type` is `"Line Search"`|
|`line_search_direction_type`|`"L-BFGS"`|`"Steepest Descent","Nonlinear Conjugate Gradient","L-BFGS","BFGS"`|`minimizer_type` is `"Line Search"`. if `line_search_type` is `"Armijo"`, cannot be `"BFGS"` or `"L-BFGS"`. |
|`nonlinear_conjugate_gradient_type`|`"Fletcher Reeves"`|`"Fletcher Reeves","Polak Ribirere","Hestenes Stiefel"`|`linear_search_direction_type` is `"Nonlinear Conjugate Gradient"`|

Any property can then be easily changed, for example,

`fit_pref.convergence= 0.5`

If the user tries to set a property to an invalid value they will get an error.


### Domain

The Domain class describes the parameter tree. 

The root of the tree is the `Domain` class. This class contains an array of `Population` classes. 
Each `Population` can contain a number of `Model` classes. Some models have children, which are also models.

#### Models

`Domain` and `Population` are two special kinds of models.

The `Domain` model is the root of the parameter tree, which can contain multiple populations. 
Populations can contain standard types of models.

The available standard model classes are:

| Model Name                    | layer_params                    | extra_params | location_params |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------|---|---|
| `UniformHollowCylinder`       | radius, ed                      | scale, background,<br/>height | x, y, z,<br/>alpha, beta, gamma
| `Sphere`                      | radius, ed                      | scale,<br/>background | x, y, z,<br/>alpha, beta, gamma
| `SymmetricLayeredSlabs`       | width, ed                       | scale, background,<br/>x_domain_size, y_domain_size | x, y, z,<br/>alpha, beta, gamma
| `AsymmetricLayeredSlabs`      | width, ed | scale, background,<br/>x_domain_size, y_domain_size | x, y, z,<br/>alpha, beta, gamma
| `Helix`                       | phase, ed,<br/>cross_section | scale, background,<br/>height, helix_radius,<br/>pitch | x, y, z,<br/>alpha, beta, gamma
| `SpacefillingSymmetry`        | distance, angle,<br/>repetitions | scale | x, y, z,<br/>alpha, beta, gamma
| `ManualSymmetry`              | x, y, z,<br/>alpha, beta, gamma | scale | x, y, z,<br/>alpha, beta, gamma
| `PDB`- a PDB file             | N/A | scale, solvent_ed,<br/>solvent_probe_radius,<br/>solvation_thickness,<br/> outer_solvent_ed, fill_holes,<br/>solvent_only, solvent_method | x, y, z,<br/>alpha, beta, gamma
| `EPDB`- an EPDB file          | N/A | scale, solvent_ed,<br/>solvent_probe_radius,<br/>solvation_thickness,<br/> outer_solvent_ed, fill_holes,<br/>solvent_only, solvent_method | x, y, z,<br/>alpha, beta, gamma
| `AMP`- an amplitude grid file | N/A | scale | x, y, z,<br/>alpha, beta, gamma

You can create any model by calling its initialization. 

Please note that models are dynamically loaded from those available in D+. 
Therefore, your code editor may underline the model in red even if the model exists. Also, unlike in D+, the 
parameters `alpha`, `beta`, `gamma` need to be given in radians.

All models have `location_params` (Location Parameters) and  `extra_params` (Extra Parameters). 
Some models (that support layers) also contain `layer_params`.
These can be accessed from `model.location_params`, `model.extra_params`, and `model.layer_params`, respectively.
Most models which have layers are initialized with two layers (indices 0, 1) where the first one (0) is the solvent layer, and the second one (1) is the first model layer.
It is possible to add more layers to the model through `model.add_layer()`.
On top of these, both PDB and EPDB can receive an anomalous file as a string, this can be done through `E/PDB.anomfile`, or be centered to their center of mass, done with the boolean `E\PDB.centered`.

They contain special custom python containers, based on standard python containers, but with validation
of what the user does to them.  
`layer_params` contains an instance of the class `Layers`, a modified list which enforces minimum/maximum length
and requires any entries to the list be instances of the class `ParameterContainer`.  
`location_params`, `extra_params`, and each entry in `layer_params` is an instance of the class `ParameterContainer`.  
`ParameterContainer` is initialized with a dictionary containing keys and values, and thereafter does not allow the addition of any new keys. It also requires the value of the keys to be set exclusively to isntances of the
`Parameter` class.

The goal of all this customization is to help the user be alerted to any mistakes they might make setting up their models.

An example of code that will raise an error:

```python
from dplus.DataModels.models import UniformHollowCylinder
uhc=UniformHollowCylinder()
uhc.layer_params[1]["radius"]=2.0 #will raise error "2.0 can only be set to an instance of Parameter"
```


Example:

```python
from dplus.DataModels.models import UniformHollowCylinder

uhc=UniformHollowCylinder()
uhc.layer_params[1]["radius"].value=2.0
uhc.extra_params["height"].value=3.0
uhc.location_params["x"].value=2
```
#### Parameters

The `Parameter` class contains the following properties:

`value`: a float whose default value is `0`

`sigma`: a float whose default value is `0`

`mutable`: a boolean whose default value is `False`

`constraints`: an instance of the `Constraints` class, its default value is the default `Constraints`

'sigma' is a parameter that does not exist in the D+ UI, but rather only in the API and is a measure for the polydispersivity of a parameter in the model. Sigma represents the full width at half-maximum of a Gaussian distribution that is applied to the parameter it is added to. 
This was inherited from X+ and more information can be found in Ben-Nun, T., Ginsburg, A., Szekely, P. & Raviv, U. (2010). J. Appl. Cryst. 43, 1522-1531.

Usage:

```python  
p=Parameter()  #creates a parameter with value: '0', sigma: '0', mutable: 'False', and the default constraints.
p=Parameter(7) #creates a parameter with value: '7', sigma: '0', mutable: 'False', and the default constraints.
p=Parameter(sigma=2) #creates a parameter with value: '0', sigma: '2', mutable: 'False', and the default constraints.
p.value= 4  #modifies the value to be 4.
p.mutable=True #modifies the value of mutable to be 'True'.
p.sigma=3 #modifies sigma to be 3.
p.constraints=Constraints(min_val=5) #sets constraints to a 'Constraints' instance whose minimum value (min_val) is 5.
```

###### Constraints

The `Constraints` class contains the following properties:

`max_value`: a float whose default value is `infinity`.

`min_value`: a float whose default value is `-infinity`.

The usage is similar to 'Parameter' class, for example:

```python
c=Constraints(min_val=5) #creates a 'Constraints' instance whose minimum value is 5 and whose maximum value is the default ('infinity').
```

## CalculationInput

The CalculationInput class inherits from the `State` class and therefore has access to all its functions and properties.

In addition, it contains the following properties of its own:

* `x`: an array of q values (self.DomainPreferences.x)
* `y`: an array of intensity values from a signal, optional. Used for running fitting. (self.DomainPreferences.y)
* `signal`: a signal class instance. (self.DomainPreferences.signal)
* `use_gpu`: a boolean whose default value is True, representing whether D+ should use the GPU
* `args`: a json dictionary of the arguments required to run generate.exe or fit.exe


A new instance of CalculationInput can be created simply by calling its constructor.
An empty constructor will cause CalculationInput to be created with default values derived from the default State, and with `use_gpu = True`.

In addition, CalculationInput has the following static methods to create an instance of GenerateInput:

* `load_from_state_file` receives the location of a file that contains a serialized parameter tree (state)
* `load_from_PDB` receives the location of a PDB file, and automatically creates a guess at the best state parameters
 based on the PDB 
 * `copy_from_state` returns a new `CalculationInput` based on an existing state or `CalculationInput`

```python
from dplus.CalculationInput import CalculationInput
gen_input=CalculationInput()
```

```python
from dplus.CalculationInput import CalculationInput
gen_input=CalculationInput.load_from_state_file('sphere.state')
```
> See *Example Two* at the end of this document for loading a model into existing `CalculationInput`. 

## Amplitudes

In the module `Amplitudes` there are 2 classes:
* `Grid` 
* `Amplitude`

### Grid

The class `Grid` is initialized with `grid_size` and `q_max`. 

`Grid` is used to create/describe a grid of `q`, `theta`, `phi` angle values. 

These values can be described using two sets of indexing:

1. The overall index `m`
2. The individual angle indices `i`, `j`, `k`

The `Grid` is created in spherical coordinates in reciprocal space.
It has `N` shells, and the parameter `grid_size` is equal to `2N`.
The  index  `i` represents the shell number that is related to `q` , which is the magnitude of the scattering vector.
`q_max` is the largest `q`  value. The index `j` corresponds to the polar (`theta`) angle on the `i`th shell, and the index `k` corresponds to the azimuthal angle, `phi` , of the `j`th polar angle on the `i`th shell. The `Grid`  is nonuniform and the `i`th shell contains 6i(3i+1) points in its `theta`-`phi`  plane.
The index `m` is a single index that describe each point on the `Grid` .
The index starts at the origin of the `Grid`, where `m=0` , and continues to the next shells, whereas each shell is arranged in a `phi`-major storage order.
There is a one-to-one relation between the two  indexing methods.

`Grid` has the following methods:

* `create_grid`: a generator that returns `q`, `theta`, `phi` angles in `phi`-major order
* `indices_from_index`: receives an overall index `m`, and returns the individual `q`, `theta`, and `phi` indices: `i`, `j`, `k`
* `angles_from_index`: receives an overall index `m`, and returns the matching `q`, `theta`, and `phi` angle values
* `angles_from_indices`: receives angle indices `i`,`j`,`k` and returns their `q`, `theta`, and `phi` angle values
* `index_from_indices`: receives angle indices `i`,`j`,`k` and returns the overall index `m` that matches them
* `indices_from_angles`: receives angles `q`, `theta`, `phi`, ands returns the matching indices `i`,`j`,`k`
* `index_from_angles`: receives angles `q`, `theta`, `phi` and returns the matching overall index `m`


```python
from dplus.Amplitudes import Grid

g = Grid(100, 5)
for ind, (q,theta,phi) in g.create_grid():
    print(g.index_from_angles(q, theta, phi))
```
### Amplitude

**Important:** The class Amplitude is *not* similar to the class AMP from Dplus.DataModels.Models.

The class `AMP` from DataModels is meant to be used as a node in a parameter tree within a `State`.
It contains a `filename` pointing to an amplitude file, an extra parameter `scale`, and a boolean `centered`. 
It can be serialized and sent as part of the Domain parameter tree to D+. 

The class `Amplitude` is a full-fledged python class.

It can be used to build an amplitude and then save that amplitude as an amplitude file,
which can then be opened in D+ (or used as the filename in `AMP`) but it itself cannot be added directly to the Domain parameter tree.
If you want to add it, you *must* save the amplitude to a file first using the `save` method, 
and then you can use the State's function `add_amplitude`, to add it to the tree.

To build an amplitude:

1. initialize the class Amplitude with `grid_size` and `q_max`. 
2. define a python function to be used for populating the grid with values (the function should receive q, theta, phi)
3. call the Ampltiude function `fill` with a pointer to the function you defined

an example of the process is given below.

It is also possible to load an existing amplitude file, and perform various python calculations upon it.

Every Amplitude contains within it an instance of the python class `Grid` described above, and 
also an instance of a C++ grid, `CJacobianSphereGrid` (wrapped in Cython), from the original D+ C++ code. 

Amplitude has the following properties:
* `complex_amplitude_array` - returns the contents of the amplitude grid as a numpy array of complex numbers. 
* `description` - an optional string the user can fill with data about the amplitude class (for example, the type of the model). 
* `headers` - Amplitude files contain headers describing the contents of the amplitude. If the python Amplitude was loaded from a file, the property headers will simply return the original headers from the file. 
If the Amplitude was created within python, headers will return some basic information about the amplitude (eg grid_size), a note that the amplitude was created in python,
and the contents of the property `description` if description was set by the user. 

Amplitude also has the following methods:
* `save` - save the information in the Amplitude class to an Amplitude file which can then be 
passed along to D+ to calculate its signal or perform fitting.
* `load` - a static function that receives a filename of an Amplitude file, and returns an Amplitude instance
with the values from that file already loaded.
* `fill` - populate a new Amplitude with values calculated by a function provided by the user. The function must 
  expect to receive at least three arguments which must lead, (q, theta, phi), but can afterwards also receive 
  others. These extra parameters must be imputted in the same order the function receives them.
* `get_interpolation` - The user *must* call `fill` before using this function unless loading an existing amplitude. Receives a single q or array of q values, a value for theta, and a value for pi. It returns a complex number, representing the *interpolated* value of the amplitude at the point(s) given
q must be between q_min and q_max. Theta must be between 0 and pi. Phi must be between 0 and 2pi. 


#### Examples:

```python
#loading an existing amplitude and viewing the values it contains
from dplus.Amplitudes import Amplitude
root_path=os.path.dirname(abspath(__file__))
my_amp = Amplitude.load(os.path.join(root_path, "files", "myamp.ampj"))
for c in my_amp.complex_amplitude_array:
    print(c)
```

```python
#creating, filling, saving, and calculating interpolation values from a new amplitude
import numpy as np
from dplus.Amplitudes import Amplitude

def my_func(q, theta, phi):
	return np.complex64(q+1 + 0.0j)

a = Amplitude(80, 7.5)
a.description= "An example amplitude"						 
a.fill(my_func)
a.save("myfile.ampj")

output_intrp = a.get_interpolation(5,3,6)
output_intrp_arr = a.get_interpolation([1,2,3],3,6)
```

```python
# Save an Amplitude to a file and then load it to a Domain param tree
from dplus.Amplitudes import Amplitude
def my_func(q, theta, phi):
        return np.complex64(q + 0.0j)

    a = Amplitude(50, 7.5)
    a.fill(my_func)
    a.description = "example"
    a.save(os.path.join(session, "artificialgrid.ampj"))
    input = CalculationInput(USE_GPU)
    input.DomainPreferences.use_grid = True
    input.DomainPreferences.q_max = 7.5
    input.DomainPreferences.grid_size = 50
    a = AMP()
    a.filename = os.path.join(session, "artificialgrid.ampj")
    a.centered = True
    input.Domain.populations[0].children.append(a)
    runner = EmbeddedLocalRunner()
    result = runner.generate(input)
```

There are examples of using Amplitudes to implement models similar to D+ in the additional examples section.

The module Amplitudes also contains two convenience functions for converting between cartesian and spherical coordinates:

* `sph2cart` receives r, theta, phi and returns x, y, z
* `cart2sph` receives x, y, z and returns r, theta, phi


```python
from dplus.Amplitudes import sph2cart, cart2sph

q, theta, phi = cart2sph(1,2,3)
x, y, z = sph2cart(q,theta,phi)

```


In addition the module contains two functions that conert old ".amp" file to ".ampj" file and vice versa
* `amp_to_ampj_converter` - receives amp file and save it as ampj file, returns the new filename
* `ampj_to_amp_converter`- receives ampj file and save it as amp file, returns the new filename

### 2D Intensities

Models that have been calculated and have an amplitude, can be reused to calculate either the crystallographic 
diffraction  of the model or its fibre diffraction. In D+, the X-Ray beam is parallel to the y-axis, and thus, 
models should be built accordingly.

#### Crystallography

To find the crystallographic diffraction pattern, one should use `my_amp.get_crystal_intensity(q_min, 
calculated_points, q_max, phi)` and only `q_min` has to be given. The parameters `calculated_points`, `phi` are defaulted to 
the values 100 and 0. In the case only `q_min` is given, it is taken to be q_max, and if both are given then D+ will 
only calculate the diffraction between them.

The parameter `phi`, which is defaulted at 0, will as such give the diffraction of the face parallel to the xz-plane.
To get another face of the model, one can use `phi` to turn the model by -phi degrees (in real space) around the 
z-axis.

An example of the usage:
```python
my_amp = Amplitude.load(r'Path\To\ampj_file')
## can also be initialized as such (after generating 1D graph)
my_amp = runner.get_amp(model.model_ptr)

cryst_diff = my_amp.get_crystal_intensity(15, calculated_points=1500)

## Plotting
qp_2d = np.linspace(-15, 15, 1500)
qz_2d = np.linspace(-15, 15, 1500)
plt.pcolormesh(qp_2d, qz_2d, cryst_diff)
```

#### Fibre Diffraction

Similarly, one can use the function ` get_intensity(q_min, calculated_points=100, q_max=None, phi_min=0, 
phi_max=2*math.pi, epsilon=1e-3, seed=0, max_iter=1000000)`. Once more, if `q_max` isn't given, then `q_min` will be 
it. One can also decide to integrate over a domain different from `[0, 2*PI]` by changing `phi_min` and `phi_max`. 
The parameter `epsilon` is the "convergence epsilon", `max_iter` is the maximum number of iterations before the 
integrator returns an answer if convergence has not been attained, and `seed` is the seed given for the random number 
generator.

It is important to note that the integration is done around the z-axis, and thus the model must be built accordingly.
An example of the usage:
```python
my_amp = Amplitude.load(r'Path\To\ampj_file')
## can also be initialized as such (after generating 1D graph)
my_amp = runner.get_amp(model.model_ptr)

fibre_diff = my_amp.get_intensity(15, calculated_points=1500)

## Plotting
qp_2d = np.linspace(-15, 15, 1500)
qz_2d = np.linspace(-15, 15, 1500)
plt.pcolormesh(qp_2d, qz_2d, fibre_diff)
```

## CalculationResult

The `CalculationResult` class is returned by the `Runner`.
The user should generally not be instantiating the class themselves.

The base `CalculationResult` class is inherited by `GenerateResult` and `FitResult`

`CalculationResult` has the following properties:

* `graph`: an OrderedDict whose keys are x values and whose values are y values.
* `y`: The raw list of y values from the results JSON
* `error` : returns the JSON error report from the dplus run

In addition, CalculationResults has the following functions:

* `get_amp(model_ptr, destination_folder)`: returns the file location of the amplitude file for given `model_ptr`.
  `destination_folder` has a default value of `None`, but if provided, the amplitude file will be copied to that location,
  and then have its address returned.
  If the model has a name, the amplitude file will be named according to the model_name. If there is no model name, the file will be named according to the model_ptr. See following example "Model Naming".
* `get_amps(destionation_folder)`: returns an array of file locations for every amplitude file created during the D+
  calculation process. `destination_folder` has a default value of `None`, but if provided, the amplitude files
  will be copied to that location.
* `get_pdb(mod_ptr, destination_folder)`: returns the file location of the PDB file for given `model_ptr`.
  `destination_folder` has a default value of `None`, but if provided, the PDB file will be copied to that location,
  and then have its address returned
* `save_to_out_file(filename)`: receives file name, and saves the results to the file.

In addition to the above:

`GenerateResult` has a property `headers`, created by D+ to describe
the job that was run. It is an Ordered Dictionary, whose keys are ModelPtrs and whose values are the header associated.

`FitResult` has two additional properties,
* `parameter_tree`: A JSON of parameters (can be used to create a new `state` with state's `load_from_dictionary`).
  Only present in fitting, not generate, results
* `result_state`: a `CalculationInput` whose `Domain` contains the optimized parameters obtained from the fitting


## FileReaders

The API contains a module FileReaders.

The module contains the class NumpyHandlingEncoder.


## Additional Usage examples


***Example One***

```python
from dplus.CalculationInput import CalculationInput
from dplus.CalculationRunner import EmbeddedLocalRunner

root_path=os.path.dirname(abspath(__file__))

runner = EmbeddedLocalRunner()
state_file = os.path.join(root_path, "files", "sphere.state")
fixed_state_file = fix_file(state_file)
input = CalculationInput.load_from_state_file(fixed_state_file, USE_GPU)
result = runner.fit(input)
```

Comments:
This program loads a state file from `sphere.state` and runs fitting with the local runner.

***Example Two***

```python
# Create CalculationInput, load UniformHollowCylinder and generate.
from dplus.CalculationInput import CalculationInput
from dplus.CalculationRunner import EmbeddedLocalRunner
from dplus.DataModels.models import UniformHollowCylinder

runner = EmbeddedLocalRunner()
uhc = UniformHollowCylinder()
uhc.layer_params[1]["radius"].value = 2.0
uhc.extra_params.height.value = 3.0
uhc.location_params.x.value = 2

caldata = CalculationInput(USE_GPU)
caldata.Domain.populations[0].add_model(uhc)
result = runner.generate(caldata)
```

***Example Three***

```python
from dplus.CalculationRunner import EmbeddedLocalRunner
from dplus.CalculationInput import CalculationInput


pdb_file = os.path.join(root_path, "files", "1JFF.pdb")
caldata = CalculationInput.load_from_PDB(pdb_file, 5)
caldata.use_gpu = USE_GPU
runner = EmbeddedLocalRunner()
result = runner.generate(caldata)
assert len(result.graph) > 0
print(result.graph)
```

***Example Four***

```python
from dplus.CalculationRunner import EmbeddedLocalRunner
from dplus.CalculationInput import CalculationInput
if not USE_GPU:
    pytest.skip("NO GPU")
API = EmbeddedLocalRunner()
state_file = os.path.join(root_path, "files", "uhc.state")
input = CalculationInput.load_from_state_file(state_file)
cylinder = input.get_model("test_cylinder")

result = API.generate(input)
input.signal = result.signal
cylinder = input.get_model("test_cylinder")
cylinder.layer_params[1].radius.value = 2
cylinder.layer_params[1].radius.mutable = True
input.FittingPreferences.convergence = 0.5
input.use_gpu = True
fit_result = API.fit(input)
assert len(fit_result.graph) > 0
```

Comments:
`fit_result.result_state` is the optimized state (i.e. the optimized parameter tree) that is returned from the fitting (`runner.fit(input)`). You can fetch the cylinder whose name is "test_cylinder" from that parameter tree, to see what its new optimized parameters are.


### Implementing Models using Amplitudes

For the purpose of these examples the models are implemented with minimal default parameters, in a realistic usage
scenario the user would set those parameters as editable properties to be changed at his convenience.

```python
from dplus.Amplitudes import Amplitude
from dplus.CalculationRunner import EmbeddedLocalRunner

import math
import numpy as np

class UniformSphere:
    def __init__(self):

        self.r=[0,1]

    @property
    def nLayers(self):
        return len(self.ED)

    def calculate(self, vq, vtheta, vphi):
        cos = math.cos

        nLayers = self.nLayers

        extraParams = self.extraParams
        r = self.r
        def closeToZero(x):
            return (math.fabs(x) < 100.0 * 2.2204460492503131E-16)

        q = math.sqrt(math.pow(vq,2) + math.pow(vtheta,2) + math.pow(vphi,2))
        if closeToZero(q):
            electrons = 0.0
            for i in range( 1, nLayers):
                electrons += (ED[i] - ED[0]) * (4.0 / 3.0) * math.pi * (r[i] ** 3 - r[i-1] ** 3)
            return np.complex64(electrons  * extraParams[0] + extraParams[1]+ 0.0j)

        res = 0.0

        for i in range(nLayers-1):
            res -= (ED[i] - ED[i + 1]) * (cos(q * r[i]) * q * r[i] - sin(q * r[i]))
        res -= (ED[nLayers - 1] - ED[0]) * (cos(q * r[nLayers - 1]) * q * r[nLayers - 1] - sin(q * r[nLayers - 1]))

        res *= 4.0 * math.pi / (q*q * q)

        res *= extraParams[0] #Multiply by scale
        res += extraParams[1] #Add background
        return np.complex64(res + 0.0j)


sphere = UniformSphere()
a = Amplitude(50, 5)
a.fill(sphere.calculate)
a.save("sphere.ampj")

input = CalculationInput()
amp_model = input.add_amplitude(a)
amp_model.centered = True
runner = EmbeddedLocalRunner()
result = runner.generate(input)
```

```python

        qx, qy, qz = q, theta, phi
        res= np.complex128(0+0j)
        if(closeToZero(qz)):
            for i in range(self.nLayers):
                res += (self.ED[i] - self.ED[0]) * 2. * (self.width[i] - self.width[i - 1])
            return res * 4. * sinc((qx * self.xDomain)/np.pi)* self.xDomain * sinc((qy * self.yDomain)/np.pi) * self.yDomain

### Python Fitting
It is possible to fit a curve using the results from Generate and numpy's built in minimization/curve fitting functions.
All that is requires is wrapping the interface code so that it receives and returns parameters the way scipy expects (eg as numpy arrays)

An example follows:

```python
import numpy as np
from scipy import optimize
from dplus.CalculationInput import CalculationInput
from dplus.CalculationRunner import EmbeddedLocalRunner

input=CalculationInput.load_from_state_file(r"2_pops.state")
generate_runner=EmbeddedLocalRunner()

def run_generate(xdata, *params):
    '''
    scipy's optimization algorithms require a function that receives an x array and an array of parameters, and
    returns a y array.
    this function will be called repeatedly, until scipy's optimization has completed.
    '''
    input.set_mutable_parameter_values(params) #we take the parameters given by scipy and place them inside our parameter tree
    generate_results=generate_runner.generate(input) #call generate
    return np.array(generate_results.y) #return the results of the generate call

x_data=input.x
y_data=input.y
p0 = input.get_mutable_parameter_values()
method='lm' #lenenberg-marquadt (see scipy documentation)
popt, pcov =optimize.curve_fit(run_generate, x_data, y_data, p0=p0, method=method)

#popt is the optimized set of parameters from those we have indicated as mutable
#we can insert them back into our CalculationInput and create the optmized parameter tree
input.set_mutable_parameter_values(popt)
#we can run generate to get the results of generate with them
best_results=generate_runner.generate(input)
```

### Model Naming
A model name can be given to a model.
If a model has a name, the get_amp function will save the amplitude file with the model name.
If the model does not have a name, the amplitude file will be named according to the model_ptr
```python
    from dplus.DataModels.models import UniformHollowCylinder
from dplus.CalculationInput import CalculationInput
from dplus.CalculationRunner import EmbeddedLocalRunner

runner = EmbeddedLocalRunner()

# without model name:
uhc=UniformHollowCylinder()
caldata = CalculationInput(USE_GPU)
caldata.Domain.populations[0].add_model(uhc)
result=runner.generate(caldata)
dest_folder = result.get_amp(uhc.model_ptr, session)
# The amplitude is saved to: seesion/00000000.ampj

# with model name:
uhc=UniformHollowCylinder()
uhc.name="test_hc"
caldata = CalculationInput(USE_GPU)
caldata.Domain.populations[0].add_model(uhc)
runner = EmbeddedLocalRunner()
result=runner.generate(caldata)
dest_folder = result.get_amp(uhc.model_ptr, session)
# The amplitude is saved to: seesion/test_hc.ampj

```

## g(r) module

The g(r) module is a complementary module to D+ and is helpful if one wants to further analyse data using the radial 
distribution function or the structure factor. It has multiple functions, part of which have been parallelized using 
DaCe (*Ben-Nun et al., Stateful Dataflow Multigraphs: A Data-Centric Model for Performance Portability on 
Heterogeneous Architectures, 2019, Proceedings of the International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis*).

It can be called like all the other modules, i.e.:
```python
    import dplus.g_r
```
The available functions inside the module are:

| Function Name     | Function Info                                                                                                                   | Input                                                                                                                       | Output      |

## ED converter

In D+'s geometric models or pdb, one can add the electron density (ED) of a solvent or of the geometric shape to take 
them into account during calculation. Since there is no such equivalent in electron diffraction, a converter has 
been built. The function receives the following:

| Function Name | Function Info                                                                                                     | Input               | Output |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------|--------|
| `convert`     | Converts the ED to its E+ equivalent from a list of atom names (a) and the number of occurences (n) or from a PDB | ED and a, n OR PDB  | result | 

To use this, one must first import `dplus.EDConverter`. The returned result has two values in it, namely `result.eED` 
and `result.coeff`, which are the equivalent "ED" and the conversion coefficient respectively.
